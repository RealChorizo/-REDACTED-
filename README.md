#  A Solana Blockchain Based Platform to Facilitate Transactions to Fund Land Development Projects
##  This platform will be used as Proof of Concept for future investors in the technology
_I don't know code, but I can communicate and get ANYTHING done, is my attitude._

I am leading this project with 6 years of Project Management practice in Construction of City Assets and currently my 3rd year in the General Contracting side Project Managing Multi-Family Developments. 

This platform is not necessary, but it is something I can find use of. 

The main goal, to put it simply, is to invite crowdfunders from around the world to fund a Construction project that will be overturned to the holders of the projects cryptocurrency token. A simple experiment and proof-of-concept. Decentralized. 

This project will be the next challenge that I face for the next 5-10 years. Delighted to be building in Web 3 again.
